                Gist -- a scripting language like data type


Gist provides script language like data structures to C++.  The data
structure is in part modeled after those found in languages like Python
and JavaScript.

Gist objects can store a variety of data types, and can automatically convert
between them as necessary.

The data types it supports are:

    *  32-bit integers
    *  character strings
    *  IEEE-748 floating point (C++'s double type)
    *  single dimensional arrays containing any gist object (indexed from zero)
    *  associative arrays containing any gist object (indexed by a variety
       of data types).

In the future, gist may also support:

    *  an arbitrary length integer type
    *  an arbitrary length floating point type
    *  a code type, representing compiled script code.

Gist overloads almost all C++ operators allowing gist objects to be used
as if they were first class data types.  Gist objects are managed by a
garbage collecting allocator.  Objects never need to be freed.  In fact,
the delete operator and the gist destructor both have no effect.

Gist is not finished.  I have used it for a few projects, and it works well,
but it needs more testing.  Also, I wrote Gist on Linux in 2005, when 64-bit
machines were still relatively new.  Compilers were still configured to
compile in 32-bit by default.  So Gist still needs a lot of work for 64-bit.

I'm publishing it now to get it out there.  Maybe someone else will pick it
up and complete it, or maybe I'll find the time to do it.  It was always
intended to be published;  I should have done it a long time ago.
